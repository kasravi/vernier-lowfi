Breeze's Meat-n-Potatoes Obxd Bank - Rev 3a - 2014-02-10
========================================================

***3a => Some adjustments, mostly missing panning assignments,
which makes a difference with some dense sounds. Also some
fine tuning with some presets. 1 duplicate replaced with a
new preset (MutePluck)... IMO, better than release 3.:)

***3 => 64 more patches for a total of 128! All vol adjusted
and tuned. Hope you enjoy the extra patches. Had a little 
fun with the names; I hope I don't offend anyone!

This was done with the 2014-02-01 release of Obxed and should 
work with the final relase of v1. If it doesn't...well... 
I suppose I'll have to revise it yet again... ;)

Notable changes: categories have changed a bit (see below) and
one preset from the original was replaced with a better version: 
TubaLubaTwo replaces TubaLuba

***2a => 24dB Multimode control reset to 0 (24db) on some 
patches for today's 2014-02-01 release of Obxd (24 dB now can
be adjusted from 24dB to 6 dB with the Multimode control)

***Note: this is the 3rd upload of this bank of 64 presets
(rev 0 was release, rev 1 was first revision).
This one conforms the original revision of this bank to the 
last dll of Obxd published by 2DaT on 2014-01-23. 

The biggest problem with this version of Obxd is that the Spread
function has been "corrected" to the behavior it should have 
had on release. Along with spread detuning between Osc 1 and 2, it
used to pitch OSC2 up by almost an additional semitone. It 
doesn't do this anymore so this revision of my bank mainly deals 
with making the oscillators sound as richly chorused as before
with those patches that used detuning (there are quite a few).  
There are additional improvements with some sounds, and this time
I checked and adjusted to make sure the sounds were tuned to concert
pitch (some were off). So I highly recommend updating to 
this version for use with the new dll. 

**About the 2nd revision: I revised and changed a few 
things, mostly level adjustments and minor tweaks. A couple of the 
patches were changed. 

Hope you enjoy this bank of 64 patches for the OBXD. You're can 
use and distribute this bank freely.

Sound Categories (***Updated 2014-02-07):
SYN = Synth
BRS = Brass
KEY = Keyboard (incl. Pluck & Bells)
LED = Synth Leads
PLK = Plucked & Guitar
BEL = Bell
INS = Instruments I couldn't place elswhere!
VOC = Vocal
PAD = Pads and Strings
BSS = Bass
PER = Percussion
SFX = Sound Effect

Notes:

-> A number of presets need to be transposed to be in concert 
pitch. Their names end with a parenthesis, a + or - indication,
and a number for the number of semitones. Ex.:"(-7"

-> Some sound names have note names (ex: (C3)) to indicate 
where they sound best. 

-> C3 = Middle C

-> Sometimes "<" or ">" are used before the note number to
indicate the ideal range. "-" means "between".

-> Sometimes sound can benefit from slight use of the modulation 
wheel, which brings in vibrato. Sometimes modifying other parameters
like cutoff can help, but being unable to map controllers to parameters
per patch and to scale them makes it impossible to preset.

-> Many of these will be seriously enhanced by the use of standard
effects like Chorus, Echo and others(!).

If you have any questions or you want to send me improved versions
of my presets ;) you can PM me at KVR: Breeze

Enjoy!

Breeze

PS: I'll probably be revising this bank from time to time.,,, ;)
